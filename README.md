# MediToken - Hospital Queue Management System
Higher Diploma in Software Engineering at NIBM

Programming Data structure module project

This project is a Hospital Queue Management System that allows for the management of patient records through a web interface. It uses JavaScript for client-side functionality and local storage (cookies) to maintain the queue state across page reloads. 

## Features

- **Patient Management:** Add new patients with details such as name, age, address, and email.
- **Queue Management:** View and manage the queue of patients, with the ability to remove patients from the queue.
- **Persistent Storage:** Patient data is stored in cookies to persist state across page reloads.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilizes TailwindCSS for styling and layout, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Email Integration:** Uses EmailJS to send emails directly from the web application.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure of web pages.
- **CSS:** TailwindCSS for styling.
- **JavaScript:** Handles dynamic content loading, patient management, and interaction.
- **Cookies:** Used for persisting patient queue data.
- **EmailJS:** Service for sending emails directly from the client-side JavaScript.

## File Structure

- **`index.html`:** Main entry point that includes the content and loads necessary JavaScript files.
- **`HTML/Manage.html`:** HTML file for managing patients (adding new patients).
- **`HTML/Display.html`:** HTML file for displaying the current queue of patients.
- **`JS/Patient.js`:** JavaScript class defining the Patient object.
- **`JS/LoadManage.js`:** JavaScript file responsible for handling page loading and patient management logic.
- **`JS/email.js:`** avaScript file for EmailJS integration

# JavaScript Classes

- **`Patient`:** Represents a patient with properties like name, age, address, and email.
- **`Node`:** A node in a linked list that holds a patient and a reference to the next node.
- **`Hospital`:** Manages a linked list of patients, including adding, removing, displaying patients, and saving/loading state to/from cookies.

2. **View Patients:** Click on the display button to view the current list of patients in the queue.
3. **Remove Patients:** Use the remove button next to each patient's details to delete them from the queue.
4. **Send Emails:** Use the integrated email functionality to send notifications or other emails as needed.
